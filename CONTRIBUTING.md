## Getting Started

### 1. Fork and Clone

```bash
# Fork the repository on GitHub, then:
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/dspy-compounding-engineering.git
cd dspy-compounding-engineering
```

### 2. Set Up Development Environment

```bash
# Install dependencies including dev tools
uv sync --group dev

# Install pre-commit hooks
uv run pre-commit install
```

### 3. Create a Branch

All pull requests must come from branches using one of the following prefixes:
- `feature/`: New functionality
- `fix/`: Bug fixes
- `testing/`: Test expansion or verification
- `chore/`: Maintenance and infrastructure

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# or
git checkout -b fix/your-bug-fix
```

## Development Workflow

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
uv run pytest

# Run with coverage
uv run pytest --cov=agents --cov=workflows --cov=utils

# Run specific tests
uv run pytest tests/test_knowledge_base.py -v
```

### Linting and Formatting

```bash
# Check code style
uv run ruff check .

# Auto-fix issues
uv run ruff check --fix .

# Format code
uv run ruff format .
```

### Running the CLI Locally

```bash
# Use uv run for development
uv run python cli.py review --help

# Or activate the venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python cli.py review
```

## Adding a New Review Agent

Review agents are specialized code reviewers. Here's how to add one:

### 1. Create the Agent File

Create `agents/review/your_agent_name.py`:

```python
import dspy

class YourAgentReviewer(dspy.Signature):
    \"\"\"Specialized review agent for [specific concern]\"\"\"
    
    file_path: str = dspy.InputField(desc="Path to the file being reviewed")
    file_content: str = dspy.InputField(desc="Content of the file")
    context: str = dspy.InputField(desc="Additional context from knowledge base")
    
    finding: str = dspy.OutputField(
        desc="Detailed finding with severity, issue, and recommendation"
    )
```

### 2. Register in `agents/review/__init__.py`

```python
from .your_agent_name import YourAgentReviewer

REVIEW_AGENTS = [
    # ... existing agents ...
    ("Your Agent Name", YourAgentReviewer),
]
```

### 3. Add Tests

Create `tests/test_your_agent.py`:

```python
import dspy
from agents.review.your_agent_name import YourAgentReviewer

def test_your_agent_reviewer():
    # Test your agent logic
    pass
```

### 4. Update Documentation

Add your agent to `docs/usage/review.md`.

## Pull Request Process

### 1. Write Good Commit Messages

We strictly follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) standard. Every commit must be prefixed with a type:
- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Formatting/Linting (no logic change)
- `refactor`: Code reorganization
- `test`: Adding or fixing tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks (dependencies, CI, metadata)

**Example**: `feat(security): implement path traversal protection`

### 2. Interactive Rebase Before Merging
Before merging your branch into `dev`, please use an interactive rebase to clean up your history into clean, logical blocks. 

```bash
# Clean up your history relative to dev
git rebase -i dev
```
Use `squash` or `fixup` to remove "noisy" commits (fix typos, work-in-progress).

### 2. Create a Pull Request

- Write a clear title and description
- Reference any related issues (#123)
- Explain what changed and why
- Include screenshots for UI changes
- Ensure all tests pass

### 3. Code Review

- Respond to feedback constructively
- Make requested changes
- Update your PR branch if needed

### 4. Merge

We use a **Squash and Merge** workflow for all Pull Requests targeting the `master` branch. This ensures our release history remains clean and readable for public users.

## Testing Guidelines

### Unit Tests

Test individual functions and classes:

```python
def test_knowledge_base_save():
    kb = KnowledgeBase()
    learning = {
        "category": "test",
        "summary": "Test learning",
        "content": "Test content"
    }
    kb.save(learning)
    assert kb.retrieve("test") is not None
```

### Integration Tests

Test workflows end-to-end:

```python
def test_review_workflow(tmp_path):
    # Create a test repository
    # Run review workflow
    # Assert findings are generated
    pass
```

## Documentation

Documentation is built with MkDocs. To preview locally:

```bash
uv run mkdocs serve
# Open http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

Update documentation in `docs/` when adding features.

## Code Style

- Follow [PEP 8](https://pep8.org/)
- Use type hints where appropriate
- Write docstrings for public functions
- Keep functions focused and small
- Prefer readability over cleverness

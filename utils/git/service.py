            # it. Actually, 'gh pr checkout' modifies the current working directory.
            # To avoid this, we should just fetch the branch.

            # Alternative: git fetch origin pull/ID/head:BRANCHNAME
            # But we need the ID.
            # Let's stick to 'gh pr checkout' but we need to be careful.
            # Wait, if we are in a worktree, we can just create ANOTHER worktree from the branch.
            # But we need the branch to exist locally first.

            # Let's use the 'gh pr checkout' but then immediately switch back? No that's bad.

            # Better approach:
            # 1. Get branch name
            # 2. git fetch origin <branch_name> (if we know the remote branch name)
            # 3. git worktree add ...

            # Actually, 'gh pr checkout' is designed to switch context.
            # If we want to review WITHOUT switching context, we should:
            # 1. Get the headRefName and headRepositoryOwner
            # 2. git fetch https://github.com/OWNER/REPO.git branch:local-branch
            # 3. git worktree add ...

            # For now, let's assume the user is okay with us fetching the branch.
            # We can use 'git fetch origin pull/ID/head:pr-ID' if we have the numeric ID.
            # But pr_id_or_url might be a URL.

            # Let's use a safer approach:
            # 1. Get PR details to find the branch name.
            # 2. Fetch that branch.
            # 3. Create worktree.

            # Simplified for this iteration:
            # We will assume 'gh pr checkout' is acceptable to get the branch locally,
            # BUT we will do it in a way that doesn't switch the current HEAD if possible?
            # No, 'gh pr checkout' definitely switches.

            # Let's use 'gh pr view' to get the branch name, then 'git fetch origin branch_name'.
            # This assumes the branch is in the same repo (not a fork).
            # If it's a fork, it's more complex.

            # Let's just use 'gh pr checkout' but save the current branch first?
            # No, that's risky.

            # Let's try to use 'gh' to just fetch.
            # 'gh pr checkout <id> --detach' ? No.

            # Let's go with:
            # 1. Get branch name.
            # 2. git fetch origin <branch_name>:<branch_name>

            # Maybe we can run 'gh pr checkout' INSIDE the new worktree?
